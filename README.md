# Digital-Electronics-Krysis-Robot
Final project design using the Krysis Robot for the Digital Electronics class (ESET 219) in the Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution department at Texas A&amp;M University. 

## Summary
The project files in this repository are of file extension .ms14. They are Multisim circuit simulation files, commonly used for designing and simulating electronic circuits.

Such files contain schematic diagrams, simulation settings, and component configurations related to the project. This repository, a final project for a digital electronics class using the Krysis Robot, contains the circuit design and simulation for controlling or interfacing with the Krysis Robot hardware.

The numbers listed in the file names are the PWM percentage values for the forward speed, turning speed, and reverse speed of the Krysis Robot. The turning and reverse speed PWM values are important for course correction of the robot.
